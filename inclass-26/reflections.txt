• What did you hope to learn but did not?
I thought I would learn Angular.JS at this class and I heard that some companies are using Angular2 right now, but it is totally fine to learn React, which seems more popular. 

• What did you really enjoy learning about?
It is all about self-learning, I really enjoy the process to build on stuffs one by one, which makes me feel pretty good to handle everything and see the results running at Web.

• What worked well in the course? and how?
The inclass assignment are really good for us to have a build-on experience, rather doing homework directly. And Scott, I would say, you are super awesome!

• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
I think the some class slides seems too fast for us to digest. Sometimes could not understanding how the thing work until finish the inclass assignment. I think for the beginner, perhaps need more logic coherence between different slides? And I think explain more real codes really helps a lot for fast learning.
Btw, the grades of inclass assignment are too strict! Sometimes I even got 0 but totally don't know why for that.

Anyway, thank you Scott!
Really enjoy the learning period from this class! It is definitely the most useful class I have learned at Rice.
