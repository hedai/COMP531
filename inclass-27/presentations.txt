1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
I think the Hybrid mobile apps are the most delivered. The slides are well produced and the presenter just show off the topic and make it clear for us who were not familiar with Hybrid mobile apps before.

2.Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
I learned most from the create.js topic. Though there were some issue to present the animation in class. I can still tell the diligence of the presenter who really pay attention on his topic. And I could get to know what is create.js easily and be willing to use that in the future when I need to add some animation effect in my web design.

3.Which talk did you like the best and why?
I like the Hybrid mobile apps talk best. The presenter is very confident and familiar with his topic. He introduced his previous experience with hybrid mobile apps. And I could get to know the difference and connection between web app, native app and hybrid app better from his talk, which is concise and eloquent.
